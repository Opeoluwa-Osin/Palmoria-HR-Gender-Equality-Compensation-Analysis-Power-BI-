# Palmoria HR Gender Equality & Compensation Analysis (Power BI)

This Power BI project explores HR data from Palmoria Group, a fictional manufacturing company based in Nigeria, facing public scrutiny for gender inequality in its workforce. As an HR Analytics Analyst, I was tasked with uncovering hidden patterns in gender distribution, salary structure, performance ratings, and bonus allocation.

The analysis focuses on uncovering potential bias and guiding executive decisions for fairer compensation and compliance with labor regulations.
